"""
This problem is to implement a simple, two player game of tic-tac-toe that can be played via the command line. It's an opportunity to focus on program state, and how our model of state affects the rest of the program.

The main takeaway, hopefully, is that it's worthwhile to think clearly about how our state should be modelled, what causes it to change, and how we respond and derive useful things from state.
